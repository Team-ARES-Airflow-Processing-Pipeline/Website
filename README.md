## Updating the Website

### Windows

The department abbreviation must be capitalized, for example EE, ME, CS, BIO, etc.
for example: /www/ceias.nau.edu/capstone/projects/ME/2008/Prometheus
When your web folder is selected, simply drag your web files from your local site over to the web folder.
After uploading your web documents you can view your webpage from a web browser at

### Mac
Once you have confirmation that your website has been set up and your group's web files have been created, you are ready to publish your site to the CEIAS web server. Access to the web server is available via a SMB connection using the "Connect to server" tool in Mac Finder.
